        <h2>About this quiz</h2>

        <h4>1. Background</h4>
        <p>About two-thirds of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are linked to household consumption! As a result, for ordinary citizens, lifestyle changes are necessary to 
            keep our planet from warming and for it to remain hospitable for us and future generations. That means preventing sea level rise, more frequent and severe weather events 
            and the spread of infectious diseases. Some of these lifestyle changes will be automatic once businesses comply, such as for utility companies to use more renewable power 
            generation. However, individual actions and choices also have a huge impact. Source: Brookings Institute.
        </p>
        <p>This quiz presents a simple way to look at individual impact and provides customized alternatives going forward.</p>
        <h4>2. Assumptions</h4>
        <p>Total emissions by activity is calculated based on what choice the user selects and assumptions related to activity/consumption level as written below:</p>
        <p>Emission (kg CO<sub>2</sub>e/yr)= Choice x Assumption x Scale x Emission Factor</p>
        <p>For example, for flights, total yearly emission is calculated by assuming that the average flight is the distance from NYC to San Francisco, person selects average 
            of 4 flights per year, multiplied by the average emission factor per passenger mile for all seat classes (source: UK Govt Conversion Factors 2024) and a scale of 
            1 since the data is already yearly.

        <h4>3. Data Sources</h4>

        <h4>3.1. What is an emission factor?</h4>
        <p>
            An emission factor (EF) is a coefficient that describes the rate at which a given activity releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p> 
            GHG emissions are often measured in CO<sub>2</sub>e (CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents) expressed in weight, normally kg (kilograms) or t (tonne/metric ton). This unit expresses 
            the 100-year warming effect of a given amount of a GHG in comparison to that of CO<sub>2</sub>. In other words, for a given amount of any GHG, CO<sub>2</sub>e expresses 
            the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that would warm the atmosphere as much as the same amount of the gas in question, over a 100-year time-frame from the moment of release. 
            For example, nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) has a "100-year" warming effect 265-298 times more than CO<sub>2</sub>.
